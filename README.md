# asciiSpirals

NOTE: Currently, this is a VERY rough draft, more of a proof of concept, of an ascii spiral application which is meant to be a testbed for a much larger spiral-generating app. Before that though, I do plan on finishing the ascii version, since ascii spirals in terminals are something I've been dreaming about for awhile.  

To use:

install python

Windows: (In admin-priv powershell, run the following commands:)  
winget search Python.Python  
winget install Python.Python.x.x  
python path/to/file  
???  
profit!!!  

Known issues:  
-For specific animations, some terminal applications stutter while clearing the screen for the next animation frame. Namely spiral4-6 and milky. Includes default Windows 11 powershell and and xfce4-terminal. Works flawlessly on kitty.

TODO:  
-refine animations, fill screen, etc  
-add feature for reactivity to audio  
-add feature for reactivity to keyboard strokes  
-combine into a single file with options -like -dis
